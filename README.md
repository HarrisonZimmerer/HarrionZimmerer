## Projects

* [**Senior Project â€” OCII Website Spoofing**](https://github.com/HarrisonZimmerer/Senior_Project_Educational_Website_Spoofing)
  Developed a simulated phishing and spoof detection environment for cybersecurity education. Built in Flask, the project demonstrated secure web development principles and provided a controlled space for students to practice identifying spoofed pages.
* [**JWT Authorization & Security Testing**](https://github.com/HarrisonZimmerer/CYB2013_Project3_JWT)
  Designed a Python-based user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens, enforcing session security, and simulating real-world authorization logic.
* [**Website Traversal Algorithm**](https://github.com/HarrisonZimmerer/CYB2013_Project2_Website_Traversal)
  Created a web traversal program using BFS and DFS search algorithms to map link structures, showcasing algorithmic reasoning and data handling.
* [**Multithreaded Web Server**](https://github.com/HarrisonZimmerer/CYB3053_Project3_Multithreaded_Web_Server)
  Implemented a concurrent web server in C using POSIX threads, managing request buffering, scheduling, and I/O operations.
* [**Custom Memory Allocator**](https://github.com/HarrisonZimmerer/CYB3053_Project2_Custom_Memeory_Allocator)
  Built a low-level heap memory manager using `sbrk()` and block coalescing to simulate core allocator behavior.
* [**WireGuard VPN Deployment**](https://github.com/HarrisonZimmerer/WireGuard_VPN_Deploymen_Docker)
  Deployed a WireGuard VPN in Docker to secure remote access, emphasizing network encryption, containerization, and Linux networking.
* **HiveStorm Blue Team Competition**
  Defended simulated enterprise systems against red team attacks, identified malicious behavior through log analysis, and implemented mitigation procedures under time pressure.
